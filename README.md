# ReactivePatternsCourse

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8. The code style and organization is a little fast and loose compared to my normal coding style. This is because the focus of the class is RXJS and I am just slinging the Angular code quickly in an effort to keep up with the important stuff. Also, there are some bad practices in here on purpose. The first portion of the class explores different ways of handling application events to make you understand why RXJS is a nice solution so there are some components intentionally created using raw javascript events or an event bus class to demonstrate why those solutions aren't easily scalable.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
